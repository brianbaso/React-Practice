/* Recitation with Doug
 * Assumption: React is basically creating regular Javascript functions that create objects when called.
 * 	- React components are like deterministic functions that return descriptions of the UI
 * A: setState() tells a component that data has changed, are there other ways to change state?
 * A: render describes how the UI looks at any point in time, so render gets called over and over again everytime state changes? How else could render get called?
 * A: How React Flows (in right window)
 *
 * Q: Why use const for all variables in the Facebook docs?
 * Request: Let's discuss the similarities and differences of props and state.
 * Q: What is the purpose of the class constructor?
